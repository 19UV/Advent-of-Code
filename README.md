# Advent of Code

In previous years I've used Node or Python, so this year (and hopefully in
future years) I plan on using C. Just C, nothing but C.

Building (Windows)
```batch
> cd advent-of-code
> cmake -B build
> cmake --build build
> build/Debug/AdventOfCode.exe
```

Building (Mac + Linux)
```bash
> cd advent-of-code
> make AdventOfCode
> ./build/AdventOfCode
```
